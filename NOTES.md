## Challenges

### General development

Since Atmel Studio isn't available on Linux and using it through Windows VM is quite painful, I started the development using Arduino IDE. The codebase grew quite quickly and soon became unmanagable. Luckily, I stumbled across [platformio](https://platformio.org/) extension to VSCode. That allowed me to clean up everything and continue development.

### Joystick

The challenge here were analog values.
